#'Two Way Design - Video game Aggression
#'
#'An example dataset used in Chapter 14 of the book 
#'\emph{Introduction to the New Statistics}.
#'
#'Hilgard (2015) asked male participants to play a video game for 15 minutes.  The game was customized
#'so that it could vary in violence (shooting zombies or helping aliens) and difficulty (targets controlled
#'by tough AI or dumb AI).  After the game, players were provoked by being given an insulting evaluation by
#'a confederate.  Participants then got to decide how long the confederate should hold their hand in painfully
#'cold ice water (0-80s in 10s increments), and this was taken as a measure of aggressive behavior.

#'  \item{difficulty}{Independent variable with two levels - \emph{easy} or \emph{hard}}
#'  \item{aggression}{Aggression score, rated from 0 seconds to 80 seconds in 10s increments}
