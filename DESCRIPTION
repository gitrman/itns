Description: The itns package contains numerous datasets from psychology studies 
    used in book Introduction to the New Statistics by Geoff Cumming 
    and Robert Calin-Jageman, published by Routledge in late 2016. 
    The datasets can be used to replicate analyses that appear in Introduction to 
    the New Statistics, and to work through the book's end-of-chapter exercises.  
    Also included is a function to compute Cohen's d for repeated measures designs.
