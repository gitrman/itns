\details{
To what extent is gender related to implicit attitudes about bias?  To find
out, Nosek and colleagues as male and female students to complete an Implicit
Association Test (IAT) that measured how easily negative ideas could be
connected to art or to mathematics.  Higher scores indicate higher levels of
bias against mathematics.

Note that all participants collected who had to be excluded due to high error rates 
or slow responses were excluded prior to creating this summary.  Data were omitted from
