#'Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) studied whether students learned more after
#'taking notes by hand rather than using a computer. They conducted a study in
#'which students were randomly assigned to take notes using a pen or by typing
#'on a laptop. The study found that students learned more after taking notes in
#'longhand than after typing notes. The researchers wondered whether writing
#'encouraged expression of concepts in the student's own words, whereas typing
#'encouraged relatively mindless transcription that led to relatively poor
#'learning. To investigate, the researchers devised a transcription score, the
#'percentage of notes that was verbatim transcription from the lecture.
