Description: escir makes it easier to compute and plot effect sizes and
    confidence intervals in R. The effect size indicies include means and mean
    differences, standardised mean differences (aka 'Cohen's d'), trimmed means,
    correlation and regression coefficients, frequencies, proportions, and risk
    ratios. escir was written to accompany the book Introduction to The New
    Statistics & Open Science (2016) by Geoff Cumming and Robert Calin-Jagerman.
